> Name Origin: Graphin, named Graph Insight (analysis of graphs), is a G6-based React component library that is simple, efficient, and out of the box.

However, it also has its cuteness. Because it is focused, it is more powerful. It integrates the functional characteristics of the industry's excellent graph analysis products and has a wide range of applications in the fields of relationship analysis, knowledge map, financial anti-fraud, and logistics security.

Graphin has a heart that wants to make a product. After open source, we will build the standard business graph analysis tool ReGraph, because the theme of this release is "to throw a brick and attract jade", I hope more people join us, in the field of graph analysis explore

Open source on November 22, coming soon...
