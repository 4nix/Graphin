## Graphin Studio

Graphin Studio is the graph analysis workbench built with [@antv/graphin](https://github.com/antvis/graphin/tree/master/packages/graphin) and [@antv/graphin-components](https://github.com/antvis/graphin/tree/master/packages/graphin-components). It served as the main playground and DEMO for Graphin.

```
