ContextMenu is a common way of information display and interaction, which can easily realize node replication, deletion, deselect, and so on. At the same time, we can also initiate a new canvas analysis on the selected node, or perform advanced custom behaviors such as marking, initiating relationship diffusion, and data request. These behaviors only need to be implemented in the onClick callback of MenuItem.

- demo-1: Use options to set the content of the right-click menu
- demo-2: Use render to customize the rendering right-click menu
