## 00. Introduction

"A line and two points constitute a graph", forms a basic of the graph. There are large amount of scenarios that requires graph to visualize the relationships. As shown in the figure below, graph plays a key role in different fields.

![Field Relationship Map](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_402c1a/afts/img/A*G8I1TaPvDogAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQnAQ)

The Graphin visualization tool launched by AntV might suits your needs to visualize the relationship graph. Let's follow the walkthrough below to experience how Graphin can help us develop a graph analysis application.

## 01. Installation Dependencies

If you are using React, you can import Graphin as a React component.

> This article uses yarn to install dependencies, and npm can also be used. The following are the core components of Graphin `@antv/graphin` and analysis components `@antv/graphin-components`, as well as the icon library provided by Graphin`@antv/graphin-icons`

```bash
yarn add @antv/graphin@latest --save
yarn add @antv/graphin-components@latest --save
yarn add @antv/graphin-icons --save
```

## 02. Visualize Relational Data

The preliminary step to perform graph analysis is to visualize relational data. Relational data is a graph structure consisting of Node and Edge. The `id` is the only required parameter in the Node, and `source` and `target` are the required parameters in the Edge, which represent the `id` of the start node and end node for the edge respectively.

<code src='./demos/index.tsx'>

## 03. Visual Channel Mapping

In the first step, we had successfully render the nodes and edges of a graph. However, the current graph styles are simple. We will utilize visual channel mapping to visualize additional information on the nodes and edges. Apart from the regular size, shape, and style, Graphin's built-in nodes and edges are standardized. The built-in node `graphin-circle` is composed of 5 parts of graphics, namely `keyshape`, `label`, `icon`, `badges`, and `halo`, they are all placed in the `style` field of the node, as shown below The `node-0` node shows:

> Note ⚠️: In order to demonstrate the effect, the full configuration files are displayed here. In actual development, we have the `Utils.genDefaultNodeStyle` tool function to help us quickly generate configuration files according to the theme style. At the same time, each node only carries part of the style it needs (Graphin does deepMerge internally with the style of each node)

<code src='./demos/node.tsx'>

Let us continue our case, `node-0` is a user, `node-1` is an enterprise, and `node-3` is another enterprise. Through the reorganization of the above-mentioned built-in nodes in Graphin, we can use the size of the node to represent the scale of the enterprise, and the `icon` of the node to display different attributes and color to distinguish it's attributes.

- 1. Label each node
- 2. Map the size of the enterprise `data.count` to the size of the node
- 3. Map the different data types `data.type` to the icon of the node
- 4. `Node-0` is the actual controlling owner behind `Node-2`, which can be mapped as a dotted edge

<code src='./demos/style.tsx'>

## 04. Choose the right layout

The most attractive thing in the graph visualization is the layout. Currently, the first layout we have come across is `preset`, which is used to render the `x` and `y` position information specified by the user onto the canvas. Let's imagine in the above example with the real development scenario. If the data is returned from the server and each data does not carry layout information, we can no longer use `preset` to preset the graph layout.
In the moment, an appropriate layout algorithm is important to draw the graph.
Let's use Graphin's built-in tool function `Utils.mock` to simulate some data and see how the graph displays with different layout algorithms

<code src='./demos/layout.tsx'>

As shown in the layout aboves, we can clearly focus on the relationship of central node with the concentric circle algorithm layout, which is sorted according to the degree of the node by default. In some gang fraud networks, you can see the key culprits at a glance. The nodes under the directed layering algorithm are arranged hierarchically according to the flow direction of the edges. In some networks with obvious flow directions, such as the capital flow network, the upstream and downstream relationships can be clearly seen.

In several general platforms, the relational data does not defined which layout algorithm to draw the graph in the beginning. The most convenient way to define the layout is to provide layout switching capabilities for users to choose layout independently. Other than that, with the full utilization of AI capabilities, we can predict the best layout based on data marking and model training. This feature are still working in progress.

<code src='./demos/layout-switching.tsx'>

## 05. Good interaction can enhance user analysis experience

When data are successfully rendered and draw with suitable layout, the product manager came to you and made a request

- The canvas should support zooming, otherwise users will not be able to view the big picture when the amount of data is huge
- Obtain feedback by click on the node, it will be great to perform "delicate" changes on the node
- Highlight the nodes and edges when hover the node to reduce visual interference
- Select nodes in batches with mouse circle selection, or draw your own area selection like the magic wand in Adobe Photoshop
- ... (100+ optimization suggestions omitted here)

Ultimately, the project manager praised you again. You are so great and believe that you can implement the graph analysis experience well. At this moment, you, suppressing the impulse in your heart, and staying up late to complete the development.

Good graph interaction can enhance the user's analytical experience. From this perspective, the product manager is right. Graphin is a technical product polished from the line of business. Therefore,, we deconstructed the interaction and encapsulated it into components, allow developers to import based on it demands and needs.

```tsx | pure
import { Behaviors } from '@antv/graphin';
const {
  TreeCollapse, // Expand and collapse the tree map
  DragCanvas, // Drag the canvas
  ZoomCanvas, //Zoom canvas
  ClickSelect, // Click to select the node
  BrushSelect, //Circle selection operation
  DragNode, // Drag node
  ResizeCanvas, // automatically adjust canvas width and height
  LassoSelect, // Lasso operation
  DragCombo, // Drag Combo
  ActivateRelations, // associated highlight
  Hoverable, // Hover operation
} = Behaviors;
```

<code src='./demos/behaviors.tsx'>

## 06. Good analysis components can improve user analysis efficiency

With the deepening of business, users have more and more analysis demands. Simple canvas and graphic element operations can no longer satisfy users' analysis demands:

- For example, the operation of nodes is not limited to clicking nodes. It is also necessary to mark nodes, drill down data, delete, and reverse selection. At this time, you need a right-click menu component.
- For example, data classification needs to be marked with contour components or legends

Graphin summarized 26 analysis components according to the guidance in the white paper "AntV Graph Visual Analysis Solution".

<code src='./demos/components.tsx'>

## 07. Precipitating these product solutions, maybe you can use them

If you have the patience to see here, then we can talk about business together. The application of graph visual analysis in different business fields actually has some points in common. For example, in the knowledge graph and financial risk control, there is a core product function, the former is `knowledge reasoning`, the latter is `risk detection`, because in these scenarios, the main use is the data analysis method of drilling down. The special point of drilling down graph data is that it is not only a dynamic process of data, but also a dynamic process of layout. The exploration problem of dynamic graphs is the first business pain point problem solved by the Graphin team. Now we abstract this problem as a combination of two technical solutions of `data-driven + progressive layout`, hoping to help everyone's business.

<code src='./demos/node-expand.tsx'>

In addition to dynamic map layout, large map exploration is also a common requirement in business. Adopting louvain algorithm aggregation, using Combo capability or node aggregation display mode, combined with MiniMap small map navigation, fish-eye magnifying glass, can initially meet the exploration needs of large maps. This piece of [DEMO can refer to](https://antv.vision/graphin-docs/graphin/case/geamaker)

The above is all the content of our quick start: through the fragmentary small DEMO, we have basically seen a basic capability of Graphin:

- Support the rendering of two different data structures: tree map and net map.
- Built-in multiple layouts, support sub-map layout, incremental layout, layout switching.
- There are combination specifications for nodes and edges, and style customization is supported.
- Support the introduction of interactive behavior combinations: Currently, 9 common interaction behaviors have been completed to meet our daily interaction needs.
- Built-in rich analysis components, currently 6 commonly used components have been completed: right-click menu ContexMenu, tooltip, minimap navigation MiniMap, legend component Legend, fisheye magnifier FishEye, contour component Hull. There are 26 components in total.
- Accumulate product functions from business types, such as dynamic map exploration and big map exploration.

If you are still interested, you can continue to read the in-depth exploration part, which will introduce you to Graphin's extension mechanism and component customization mechanism, as well as GraphinStudio that we will focus on next.
